# sql-challenge

In this weeks homework assignment I was given 6 csv files that needed to be sorted out and identifed.
With quick database diagramns I sorted all the csv files by 'sketching' out the tables. By sketching the table I displayed the relationships each table had with one another by identifying the primary keys and foreign keys. I also add what data type was being used for each column in tbe tables.
Once I felt confident in my sketch I then created a table schema in pgadmin to create all 6 tables.
I then imported the given info for the csv files into the the table so I could run my queries.
I then ran queries that I learned though out the week from class to answer all 8 questions.
select
from
where
join 
  where used to create these queries.
